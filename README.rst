 zotxt: a Zotero extension for text
====================================

zotxt is a Zotero extension for supporting utilities that deal with
plain text files (e.g., markdown, reStructuredText, latex, etc.)

zotxt is still in development, and is primarily for developers to use.

You can build yourself from the files in ``extension``::

  zip zotxt.xpi bootstrap.js install.rdf
